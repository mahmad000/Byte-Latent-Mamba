# Byte-Latent-Mamba
[IEEE TGRS] Byte Latent Mamba with State Space and Knowledge Distillation for Hyperspectral Image Classification

> Official implementation of **“Byte Latent Mamba with State Space and Knowledge Distillation for Hyperspectral Image Classification (HSIC)”**, accepted at **IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing (TGRS)**.  
> BLM-KD removes explicit tokenization, learns **byte-level spectral–spatial representations**, integrates a **Structured State-Space Model (SSM)** for long-range dependencies, and applies **adaptive knowledge distillation** for a compact, accurate student model.
